              <h2 class="places">South End</h2>
              <p>"My wife Kate and I for the last 4 years have been making a yearly trip to Boston to visit family. The South End is currently our favorite neighborhood to explore & hang out in after leaving the airport. Conveniently close to the airport as well. We usually find parking and go for a stroll around the neighborhood. While in the South End, lunch or dinner at Picco is a must. This is definitely one of our favorite pizza joints."</p>

                <h2 class="places">Hingham</h2>
                <p>The first half of our trip when not exploring the city is spent in Hingham. It's a town in metropolitan Greater Boston on the South Shore of Massachusetts. This is where Kate's Aunt Kathy & Uncle Ed live. Plenty of R&R along with good times happen when staying with them. Such gracious hosts who we enjoy spending quality time with.</p>

                <h2 class="places">Beacon Hill</h2>
                <p>We always like to spend an entire day in the city learning something about the city's history, checking out a museum, or taking some of historical tour. This year we checked out the <a href="http://maah.org/">Museum of African American History</a>, the <a href="http://maah.org/site14.htm">African meeting House</a>, & the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/boaf/learn/historyculture/shaw.htm">Robert Gould Shaw Memorial</a> near the Beacon Hill area of Boston. The museum had a really cool exihibit on Frederick Douglass. The civil rights movement originated in the meeting house next door. The 1863 recruitment to the 54th Massachusetts Regiment led by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw also occured here.</p>

                <h2 class="places">Boston Common</h2>
                <p>Boston Common is another place we always find ourselves coming back to each year in downtown Boston. Dating from 1634, it is the oldest city park in the United States. Cool place to walk around in & chill.</p>

                <h2 class="places">Weston</h2>
                <p>The last half of our trip is spent in Weston with Kate's cousin Elizabeth, her husband Philippe, & their 3 children Camille, Sebastian, and Louisa. It's a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States in the Boston metro area. We have lots of fun hanging out with these guys. The kids are a joy to be around and we always look forward to having dinner & a night out on the town with Elizabeth & Philippe. This year we had dinner at an awesome restaurant by the name of <a href="https://www.craigieonmain.com/">Craigie on Main</a>.</p>
